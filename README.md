# Movie-Industry-Visualization

Will we see artificially intelligent computers take over all creative roles ‐ writing, directing, and acting
among them? It is indeed a possibility, and we must ask ourselves if that is a future we want for ourselves.
Or is it something that will become a partnership ‐ AI/human? I have few visualizations from the past three
decades of the movie industry to prove that the animated genre‐based movies are overgrowing.
